# Notes

## Finding maximum N_c to use
Using jobs from ´230719´, specifically jobs with ids
- 135672723
- 135672725

These show that $N_c$ need not be larger than 10, since the error becomes smaller than computer precision and cuts off. 

p.s. Plot logarithmically

## comparing more stuff
 Planning on doing a comparison of hom to 4 different inhomogeneous systems with different lenght scales
 - different autocorrelations of the systems
 - will be using a sine wave to easily determine the autocorreltaion of the system
