  abstract = {Recently developed parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetric non-Hermitian systems govern a rich variety of new and characteristically distinct physical properties, which may or may not have a direct analog in their Hermitian counterparts. We study here a non-Hermitian, PT-symmetric superconducting Hamiltonian that possesses real quasiparticle spectrum in the PT-region of the Brillouin zone. Within a single-band mean-field theory, we find that real quasiparticle energies are possible when the superconducting order parameter itself is either Hermitian or anti-Hermitian. Within the corresponding Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, we find that several properties are characteristically distinct and novel in the non-Hermitian pairing case than its Hermitian counterpart. One of our significant findings is that while a Hermitian superconductor gives a second order phase transition, the non-Hermitian one produces a robust first order phase transition. The corresponding thermodynamic properties, and the Meissner effect are also modified accordingly. Finally, we discuss how such a PT-symmetric pairings can emerge from an anti-symmetric potential, such as the Dzyloshinskii-Moria interaction, but with an external external bath, or complex potential, among others.},

  abstract = {We suggest and implement a new Monte Carlo strategy for correlated modelsinvolving fermions strongly coupled to classical degrees of freedom, with accurate handling of quenched disorder as well. Current methods iteratively diagonalise the full Hamiltonian for a system of N sites with computation time{$\tau$}N {$\sim$}N4. This limits achievable sizes to N {$\sim$}100. In our method the energy cost of a Monte Carlo update is computed fromthe Hamiltonian of a cluster, of size Nc, constructed around the referencesite, and embedded in the larger system. As MC steps sweep over the system,the cluster Hamiltonian also moves, being reconstructed at each site wherean update is attempted. In this method{$\tau$}N,Nc{$\sim$}NNc3.Our results are obviously exact when Nc=N,and converge quickly to this asymptote with increasing Nc, particularlyin the presence of disorder.We provide detailed benchmarks on the Holstein model and the double exchangemodel. The `locality' of the energy cost, as evidenced by our results, suggests that several important but inaccessible problems can now be handledwith control. This method forms the basis of our studies in Europhys. Lett.68, 564 (2004), Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 136601 (2005), andPhys. Rev. Lett. 96, 016602 (2006).},

Thus, the present approach leads to a numerical construction of a low-energy effective theory in superconductivity. The combination with the polynomial expansion method allows a self-consistent calculation of the BdG equations. Through numerical calculations of quasi-particle excitations in a vortex lattice, thermal conductivity, and nuclear magnetic relaxation rate, we show that our approach is suitable for evaluating physical quantities in a large-size superconductor and a nano-scale superconducting device, with the mean-field superconducting theory.},

  abstract = {The first ever phenomenological theory of superconductivity was propounded by London brothers (Fritz and Heinz) by correlating the current in a superconductor with a vector potential and using Maxwell equations. Theory explained well the vanishing of resistivity and the occurrence of Meissner effect in metallic superconductors. An expression for London penetration depth {$\lambda$} was given which was confirmed experimentally. Another phenomenological theory was proposed by Ginzberg and Landau (G-L theory) introducing the concept of an order parameter and a temperature dependent coherence length which close to 0~K is similar to the temperature independent Pippard coherence length. The most successful theory, the microscopic BCS theory ultimately came from three physicists Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer in 1957. They argued that two electrons with equal and opposite momenta form a bound pair (Cooper pair), a boson, via the exchange of a virtual phonon overcoming the Coulomb repulsion. These pairs (bosons) condense into a ground state, a gap appears in the energy spectrum and the system turns superconducting. The energy gap goes down to zero at Tc. Theory however could not explain the so called high temperature cuprate superconductors (HTS) which are similar to BCS superconductors in several respects but differ drastically in many others. There is no evidence of phonon mediation in pair formation in these materials as evidenced from the absence of isotope effect. After many attempts and a long turmoil two theories have found some acceptance. First, is the RVB resonance valence bond (RVB) theory proposed by P.W. Anderson and the other is spin fluctuation theory proposed by P. Monthoux. The two concepts are qualitatively described briefly in this chapter. Last word on theory is, however, yet to come.},

New collective fermion variables are introduced which are linear combinations of creation and annihilation operators of electrons, and describe elementary excitations. They lead to a simple classification of excited states and a great simplification in the calculations. The structure of the excitation spectrum is investigated without equating the matrix element of the interaction potential to a constant at an early stage, and new relationships and equations are derived. The temperature dependent problem is described by means of a statistical operator, and its relationship to that of the grand canonical ensemble is established. Simple new relationships are obtained for the correlation function.},

For the perfect square or rectangular sample, a single-domain-wall state tends to emerge, accompanied by a vertical or horizontal domain wall separating the regions with different chiralities. This type of domain walls can be effectively tuned by temperature and the aspect ratio of samples, and the multi-domain-wall state containing two domain walls can be obtained. Moreover, for a p-wave square loop with a centered hole, the diagonal-symmetric mode for orders is presented, leading to four domain walls placed at the center of four arms of the loop. In particular, several peculiar domain-wall states may show up in the asymmetric square loop system with an off-centered hole.},
